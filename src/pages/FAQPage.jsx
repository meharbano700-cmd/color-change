const faqs = [{
  question: "Is the internship paid or unpaid?",
  answer: "Most tracks are unpaid, project-based internships focused on mentorship, live projects and portfolio outcomes. Some cohorts include performance-based stipends — your mentor will confirm what applies to your track when you're matched."
}, {
  question: "How much time do I need to commit each week?",
  answer: "Plan for a few focused hours per week between coding sessions, mentor check-ins and code review. The exact pace is flexible and set with your mentor based on your track and availability."
}, {
  question: "Do I need prior experience to apply?",
  answer: "No. Some tracks welcome complete beginners who are motivated to learn, while others (like Cloud & DevOps or Data Science) benefit from basic familiarity with the field. Your application will note what's helpful for each track."
}, {
  question: "Is the internship remote?",
  answer: "Yes, every track is fully remote. You'll work with your mentor and team through video calls, async check-ins and the same tools real distributed engineering teams use."
}, {
  question: "Will I get a certificate or reference?",
  answer: "You'll receive a completion certificate, and mentors who see strong, consistent work are happy to provide a LinkedIn recommendation or reference for future applications."
}, {
  question: "What happens after I submit my application?",
  answer: "You'll hear back within 5–7 days for a short mentor conversation, then be matched to a track and a live project. See the How It Works page for the full breakdown of every stage."
}, {
  question: "Can I switch courses after starting?",
  answer: "It's easiest to confirm your track before starting so your mentor can plan your roadmap, but talk to your mentor early if you feel a different field is a better fit — we'd rather you finish in the right track."
